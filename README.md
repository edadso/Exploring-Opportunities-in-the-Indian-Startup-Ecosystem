# Exploring-Opportunities-in-the-Indian-Startup-Ecosystem

My hypothetical team aims to strategically enter the Indian Startup Ecosystem by leveraging data-driven insights to identify high-potential opportunities. Through comprehensive research and analysis, we seek to gain insight into funding received by startups in India from 2018 to 2021.

The project followed the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework methodology to solve the problem at hand.

# Data Understanding
This data provides information into amount of money startups received from 2018 to 2021, the sector of startups, headquaters, what a startup do, the year of establishment, startup name, investors, and stage.<br>

`Columns`:
- **company_brand:** Name of startup
- **founded:** Year of establishment
- **headquarter:** Location of startup Headquater
- **sector:** Sector or industry of startup
- **what_it_does:** what the startup does
- **founders:** Name of founder
- **investors:** Name of investor
- **amount:** Amount of investment in USD and INR
- **statge:** Funding stage/ Phase of development (eg. Ideation stage, Validation stage, Scaling stage (Series B, etc.))
- **funding_year:** Year startup received funding

### Data Collection
The datasets for the analysis were retrieved from from different sources. The 2020 and 2021 datasets were retrieved from a remote database while, the 2018 and 2019 datasets in CSV file format were retrieved from a GtHub repository and OneDrive respectively. Eventually, merging these datasets would be essential at a point to consolidate the information for comprehensive analysis

### Data Exploration
The datasets were examined and explored to better understand the datasets and identify issues present. Also, the data quality was verified to understand how clean or dirty the datasets are.<br>
**Steps**:<br>
- The four datasets were explored individually
- The four datasets were concatenated and cleaned as a single DataFrame

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning process, included handling missing values, removing duplicates, filling missing values, correcting data types, standardisation of column names, and putting values in their appropriate columns.
These were carried out column by column to ensure data is thoroughly cleaned and ready for analysis.
